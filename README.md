# LearnToCode Demos

This repository is where I will push all of my lecture/demo code.

To get the latest code you will need to pull the latest code at least daily.

```bash
git pull
```

Feel free to follow along with the sample code, there is no risk that you will accidentally break the code for someone else. (You will not be able to push your changes to this repository).

## Repo Structure

This repo will be structured similar to the structure of the class exercises. There will be a new folder for each week named `Workbook1`, `Workbook2` and so on.

In each workbook folder I will create sub-folders to organize the topics that we are discussing.

### Example 1

```bash
LearnToCode_Demos
    - Workbook1
        - intro-to-html/
            - index.html
            - page-structure.html
```

As we work through the exercises in class, you can follow along in this folder. When I complete my demos, I will push my changes to a new folder with the completed work. This will ensure that none of your code will be affected by my changes.

### Example 2

```bash
LearnToCode_Demos
    - Workbook1
        - intro-to-html/
            - index.html
            - page-structure.html
        - intro-to-html-final/
            - index.html
            - page-structure.html
```
